1、incomplete codes is our offering demo, which runs on MATLAB 2019b.
2、demo_rgb_on_tnn.m is the main file of our method, which includes the loading of data, the precomputation of SSP. It is the entrance of codes.
3、LT3DSSP is the our algorithm, which includes a key file called "tnnWithPriorGithub". 
4、Quallity_ASSESS is the tool box of our methods, which is used.
5、Carphone_0.1Noise.mat is our offering datasets as examples to run our method.
6、Complete codes, especially, "tnnWithPriorGithub" file, will be public upon its acceptness.
